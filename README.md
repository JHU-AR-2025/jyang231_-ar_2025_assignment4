For clarification,

I have two branches in my repository: main and unity-code.

The main branch contains everything, which should be good for submission.
However, I initially copied and pasted my Unity project files into the repo folder from my local project folder, which may have some file path issues (just in case).

To avoid further problems, I created a separate unity-code branch that was committed and pushed directly from the Unity project folder. Please note that the unity-code branch was uploaded within 24 hours of the deadline. I hope this wonâ€™t cause any issues.

Thank you!
