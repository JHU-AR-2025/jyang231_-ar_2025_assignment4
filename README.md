For clarification, <br>
I have two branches in my repository: main and unity-code. <br>
The main branch contains everything, which should be good for submission. <br>
However, I initially copied and pasted my Unity project files into the repo folder from my local project folder, which may have some file path issues (just in case).<br>
To avoid further problems, I created a separate unity-code branch that was committed and pushed directly from the Unity project folder. Please note that the unity-code branch was uploaded within 24 hours of the deadline. I hope this wonâ€™t cause any issues.<br>
Thank you!
